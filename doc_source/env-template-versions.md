# Template versions<a name="env-template-versions"></a>

As an administrator or part of a platform team, you define, create and manage the environment templates\.

You register and propagate minor versions in Proton\. You can do this without involving developers\. Minor versions must be backward compatible\. Proton fails a new minor version registration if itâ€™s not backward compatible\.

Major versions require new inputs from the developer due to template schema changes\.

Proton makes a best\-effort attempt to determine whether the new version's schema is backward compatible with the previous minor versions of the template\. However, it does not check whether the template bundle CloudFormation template is backward compatible with the previous minor versions\. For example, Proton does not check whether the new CloudFormation template will cause breaking changes for the applications that are running on the infrastructure provisioned by a previous minor version of the template\.

When a new version's schema is backward compatible, you're responsible for determining how changes to the template bundle CloudFormation templates impact applications and resources running on previous versions of the environment template\. Based on the determination, it is up to you, as an administrator, to decide if the new version is designated as a major or minor version\.

When you publish a new version of an environment template, it becomes the **Recommended** version if it's the highest major and minor version\. New environments are created using the new recommended version, and Proton prompts administrators to use the new version and to update existing environments that are using an outdated version\.
