# Update a service pipeline<a name="ag-svc-pipeline-update"></a>

There are four modes for updating a service pipeline as described in the following\. When using the AWS CLI, the `version-update-type` field defines the mode\. When using the console, these modes map to the **Edit pipeline** and **Update to recommended version**\.

  
`NO_DEPLOY`  
In this mode, there is no interaction with the underlying resources\. Only the requested metadata parameters are updated\.

  
`UPDATE_SPEC`  
In this mode, the service pipeline is updated to use the new specs provided\. Only requested parameters are updated\.

  
`MINOR_VERSION`  
In this mode, the service pipeline is updated to use the published, recommended \(latest\) minor version of the current major version in use\.

  
`MAJOR_VERSION`  
In this mode, the service pipeline is updated to use the published, recommended \(latest\) major and minor version of the current template\.

Update a service pipeline using the console as described in the following steps\.

1. From the [Proton console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/proton/), choose **Services**\.

1. From the list of services, click on the name of the service that you want to update the pipeline for\.

1. There are two tabs on the service detail page, **Overview** and **Pipeline**\. Click on **Pipeline**\.

1. If you want to update specs, click on **Edit Pipeline** and fill out each form and select **Next** until you complete the final form and click on **Update pipeline**\.

   If you want to update the template version and there's an **information icon** indicating a new version is available at **Pipeline template**, click on the name of the new template version\.

   1. Click on **Update to recommended version**\.

   1. Fill out each form and select **Next** until you complete the final form and click on **Update**\.

The following example shows how to use the AWS CLI to update a service pipeline\.

```
aws proton --region region-id update-service-pipeline --service-instance-name "instance-one" --service-name --spec file://service-spec.yaml --template-major-version-id "1" --template-minor-version-id "1" --version-update-type "MINOR_VERSION"
```
